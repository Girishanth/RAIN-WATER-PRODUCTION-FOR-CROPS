## 📌 Abstract
This project presents a **sustainable rainwater harvesting system** designed to collect, filter, and store rainwater for efficient crop production. By reducing groundwater dependency, it supports eco-friendly farming and ensures reliable irrigation for healthy crop growth.

---

## ✨ Features
- 💧 Collects & stores rainwater efficiently  
- 🌾 Provides optimized water supply for crops  
- ⚡ Low-cost, eco-friendly & farmer-friendly  
- 🔧 Easy installation and maintenance  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies / Components Used
- 🖥️ Arduino / Microcontroller (for automation)  
- 🌡️ Soil Moisture Sensors  
- 🚰 Water Storage Tanks & Filtration Units  
- 🔌 Pumps & Irrigation Channels
